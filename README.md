# Robert Redford Conservancy IQAir Project

## IMPORTANT: Data should be kept private, participants' names should not be publicly attached to the project or any addresses used.

### MAJOR FINDINGS

 * Average PM2.5 concentration in the IE is 200% higher than the WHO health standard and 67% higher than the CA standard
 * 96.8% of data points at IE households do not meet the California standard of 9 ug/m3 PM2.5
 
### IMPLICATIONS

 * IE PM2.5 = 15.02 μg/m3, US PM2.5 = 7.08 μg/m3 —> higher risk of medical conditions
   * 2% increase in respiratory disease risk (Zanobetti et al., 2009)
   * 6% increase in lung cancer mortality (Pope et al., 2002)
   * 30% increase in lung cancer risk (Raaschou-Nielsen et al., 2013)
   * 101% increase in lung adenocarcinoma risk (Raaschou-Nielsen et al., 2013)
 * These direct, controlled correlation are sometimes minor, but combined with economic factors leading to lower access to healthcare the effect is magnified

### TO DO

 * Match 6 missing monitors to addresses
 * Figure out how to use the API
 * Create plots
 * Create maps
 * Create an interactive and accessible dashboard that allows customization of variables
 * Budget for shiny app hosting and API access if necessary
 
### DONE

- Get the IQAir data imports
- Verify that the wrangling pipeline works
